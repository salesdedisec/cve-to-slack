# cve-to-slack

A bash script that hits the API at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) to check CVE for keywords and sends the results to a Slack webhook.

## Features

- Customizable keyword search
- Easy integration with Slack
- Automated vulnerability tracking

## Keywords

At the top of the script, you can enter as many keywords as you like, separated by spaces. For example:

```bash
keywords="sql mongo apache"
```

## How To Use

1. **Copy the file to a folder**

2. **Open your IDE of choice**

3. **Navigate to the folder**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```

4. **Make \`cve2.sh\` executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x cve2.sh
   ```

5. **Ensure \`jq\` is installed**

   ```bash
   jq --version
   ```

   If \`jq\` is not installed, install it using the following commands:

   ```bash
   curl -Lo jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-osx-amd64
   chmod +x ./jq
   sudo mv jq /usr/local/bin/jq
   jq --version
   ```

6. **Update the Slack webhook URL in the script**

   Replace \`CHANGEME\` with your actual Slack webhook URL. It should look something like:

   ```plaintext
   https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000000/B00000/W0000000
   ```

7. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   ./cve2.sh
   ```

## Automation

Set up a cron job to run the script on a schedule. For example, to run it every day at midnight, you can add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/folder/cve2.sh
```
