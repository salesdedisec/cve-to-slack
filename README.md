# cve-to-slack
A bash script that hits the API at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities to check CVE for keywords and sends to a slack webhook.

At the top of the script you can enter as many keywords as you like, seperated by spaces.
eg.

keywords="sql mongo apache"

# How To
Copy file to folder

Open your IDE of choice

'cd' to folder

Make cve2.sh executable by entering "chmod +x cve2.sh"

Make sure jq is installed, "jq --version",


If not, we need to install it

curl -Lo jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-osx-amd64

chmod +x ./jq

sudo mv jq /usr/local/bin/jq

Check it's installed, jq --version

Be sure to update in the script your slack webhook URL - CHANGEME should be something like https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000000/B00000/W0000000
now to run, ./cve2.sh


Setup a cron to run on a schedule.
